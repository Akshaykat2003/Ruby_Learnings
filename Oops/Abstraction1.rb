# Shape Hierarchy
# Create an abstract base class Shape with the following characteristics:
# A method area (abstract) that must be implemented by any subclass.
# Define two subclasses Circle and Rectangle. The Circle class should calculate its area using the formula Ï€r^2, and the Rectangle class should calculate its area using width * height.
# Create an instance of each subclass and calculate and display their areas.
